    <title>Introduction</title>

    <para><ulink url="http://www.languagetool.org">LanguageTool</ulink> is an
    Open Source style and grammar proofreading software for English, French,
    German, Polish, Dutch, Romanian, and a number of other languages - see the
    <ulink url="http://www.languagetool.org/languages/">list of supported
    languages</ulink>.</para>

    <para>You can think of LanguageTool as a software to detect errors that a
    simple spell checker cannot detect, e.g. mixing up there/their, no/now
    etc. It can also detect some grammar mistakes. It does not include spell
    checking. LanguageTool will find errors for which a rule has been defined
    in its language-specific configuration files.</para>

    <title>Installation and Use</title>

    <para>The LanguageTool plugin for OmegaT can be downloaded from the <ulink
    url="http://sourceforge.net/projects/omegat-plugins/files">OmegaT plugins
    download site</ulink>. Unzip the files, and put them all in the "plugins"
    folder located in OmegaT installation folder, that is the folder that
    contains the OmegaT.jar. Create the "plugins" folder first, if it does not
    exist.</para>

    <para>Once installed, the plugin will be used automatically by OmegaT, if
    <guimenuitem>Options &gt; Language Checker</guimenuitem> is checked. The
    rules applied (if any) will depend on the source and target language of
    the project. When a rule is triggered, the corresponding phrase will be
    underlined in blue in the Editor (see <emphasis>also </emphasis>and
    <emphasis>I didn't do nothing</emphasis> in the picture above). When
    hovering the mouse over the underlined phrase, an explanation will
    appear.</para>
