            <para>The /tm/ folder can contain any number of ancillary
            translation memories - i.e. tmx files. Such files can be created
            in any of the three varieties indicated above. Note that other CAT
            tools can export (and import as well) tmx files, usually in all
            three forms. The best thing of course is to use OmegaT-specific
            TMX files (see above), so that the in-line formatting within the
            segment is retained.</para>

            <para>The contents of translation memories in the tm subfolder
            serve to generate suggestions for the text(s) to be translated.
            Any text, already translated and stored in those files, will
            appear among the fuzzy matches, if it is sufficiently similar to
            the text currently being translated.</para>

            <para>If the source segment in one of the ancillary TMs is
            identical to the text being translated, OmegaT acts as defined in

            accepted), the translation from the ancillary TM is accepted and
            prefixed with<emphasis> [fuzzy]</emphasis>, so that the translator
            can review the translations at a later stage and check whether the
            segments tagged this way, have been translated correctly (see the

            the<filename> tm</filename> subfolder, contain segments with
            identical source text, but differing targets. TMX files are read
            sorted by their names and segments within a given TMX file line by
            line. The last segment with the identical source text will thus
            prevail (Note: of course it makes more sense to avoid this to
            happen in the first place).</para>

            <para>If it is clear from the very start, that translations in a

      <para>Optionally, you can let <application>OmegaT</application> have an
      additional tmx file (<application>OmegaT</application>-style) anywhere
      you specify, containing all translatable segments of the project. See
      pseudo-translated memory below.</para>

      <para>Note that all the translation memories are loaded into memory when
      the project is opened. Back-ups are produced regularly of the project
      translation memory (see next chapter), and
      <filename>project_save.tmx</filename> is also saved/updated when the
      project is closed or loaded again. This means for instance that you do
      not need to exit a project you are currently working on if you decide to
      add another ancillary TM to it: you simply reload the project, and the
      changes you have made will be included.</para>

      <para>The locations of the various different translation memories for a
      given project are user-defined (see Project dialog window in <link
      linkend="chapter.instant.start.guide">Instant start guide)</link></para>

      <para>Depending on the situation, different strategies are thus
      possible, for instance:</para>

      <para><emphasis role="bold">several projects on the same subject:
      </emphasis>keep the project structure, and change source and target
      directories (Source = source/order1, target = target/order1 etc). Note
      that you segments from order1, that are not present in order2 and other
      subsequent jobs, will be tagged as orphan segments; however, they will
      still be useful for getting fuzzy matches.</para>

      <para><emphasis role="bold">several translators working on the same
      project:</emphasis> split the source files into source/Alice,
      source/Bob... and allocate them to team members (Alice, Bob ...). They
      can then create their own projects and, deliver their own
      <filename>project_save.tmx</filename>, when finished or when a given
      milestone has been reached. The <filename>project_save.tmx</filename>
      files are then collected and possible conflicts as regards terminology
      for instance get resolved. A new version of the master TM is then
      created, either to be put in team members'
      <emphasis>tm/auto</emphasis>subdirectories or to replace their
      <filename>project_save.tmx</filename> files. The team can also use the
      same subfolder structure for the target files. This allows them for
      instance to check at any moment, whether the target version for the
      complete project is still OK</para>

      <para>tmx files contain translation units, made of a number of
      equivalent segments in several languages. A translation unit comprises
      at least two translation unit variations (TUV). Either can be used as
      the source or target.</para>

      <para>The settings in your project indicate which is the source and
      which the target language. OmegaT thus takes the TUV segments
      corresponding to the project's source and target language codes and uses
      them as the source and target segments respectively. OmegaT recognizes
      the language codes using the following two standard conventions :</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>2 letters (e.g. JA for Japanese), or</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>2- or 3-letter language code followed by the 2-letter country
          code (e.g. EN-US - See <xref linkend="appendix.languages"/> for a
          partial list of language and country codes).</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>If the project language codes and the tmx language codes fully
      match, the segments are loaded in memory. If languages match but not the
      country, the segments still get loaded. If neither the language code not
      the country code match, the segments will be ignored.</para>

          <secondary>multilingual, handling of</secondary>
        </indexterm>TMX files can generally contain translation units with
      several candidate languages. If for a given source segment there is no
      entry for the selected target language, all other target segments are
      loaded, regardless of the language. For instance, if the language pair
      of the project is DE-FR, it can be still be of some help to see hits in
      the DE-EN translation, if there's none in the DE-FR pair.</para>

    <para>Initially, that is when the project is created, the main TM of the
    project, <filename>project_save.tmx</filename> is empty. This TM gradually
    becomes filled during the translation. To speed up this process, existing
    translations can be reused. If a given sentence has already been
    translated once, and translated correctly, there is no need for it to be
    retranslated. Translation memories may also contain reference
    translations: multinational legislation, such as that of the European
    Community, is a typical example.</para>

    <para>When you create the target documents in an
    <application>OmegaT</application> project, the translation memory of the
    project is outputted in the form of three files in the root folder of your
    <application>OmegaT</application> project (see the above description). You
    can regard these three tmx files (<filename>-omegat.tmx</filename>,
    <filename>-level1.tmx</filename> and <filename>-level2.tmx</filename>) as
    an "export translation memory", i.e. as an export of your current
    project's content in bilingual form.</para>

    <para>Should you wish to reuse a translation memory from a previous
    project (for example because the new project is similar to the previous
    project, or uses terminology which might have been used before), you can
    use these translation memories as "input translation memories", i.e. for
    import into your new project. In this case, place the translation memories
    you wish to use in the <emphasis>/tm</emphasis> or
    <emphasis>/tm</emphasis>/auto folder of your new project: in the former
    case you will get hits from these translation memories in the fuzzy
    matches viewer, and in the latter case these TMs will be used to
    pre-translate your source text.</para>

    <para>By default, the /tm folder is below the project's root folder (e.g.
    ...<emphasis>/MyProject/tm</emphasis>), but you can choose a different
    folder in the project properties dialog if you wish. This is useful if you
    frequently use translation memories produced in the past, for example
    because they are on the same subject or for the same customer. In this
    case, a useful procedure would be:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>Create a folder (a "repository folder") in a convenient location
        on your hard drive for the translation memories for a particular
        customer or subject.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>Whenever you finish a project, copy one of the three "export"
        translation memory files from the root folder of the project to the
        repository folder.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>When you begin a new project on the same subject or for the same
        customer, navigate to the repository folder in the
        <guimenuitem>Project &gt; Properties &gt; Edit Project
        dialog</guimenuitem> and select it as the translation memory
        folder.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>Note that all the tmx files in the /tm repository are parsed when
    the project is opened, so putting all different TMs you may have on hand
    into this folder may unnecessarily slow OmegaT down. You may even consider
    removing those that are not required any more, once you have used their
    contents to fill up the <filename>project-save.tmx </filename>file.</para>

    <section>
      <title>Importing and exporting translation memories</title>

      <para>OmegaT supports imported tmx versions 1.1-1.4b (both level 1 and
      level 2). This enables the translation memories produced by other tools
      to be read by OmegaT. However, OmegaT does not fully support imported
      level 2 tmx files (these store not only the translation, but also the
      formatting). Level 2 tmx files will still be imported and their textual
      content can be seen in OmegaT, but the quality of fuzzy matches will be
      somewhat lower.</para>

      <para>OmegaT follows very strict procedures when loading translation
      memory (tmx) files. If an error is found in such a file, OmegaT will
      indicate the position within the defective file at which the error is
      located.</para>

      <para>Some tools are known to produce invalid tmx files under certain
      conditions. If you wish to use such files as reference translations in
      OmegaT, they must be repaired, or OmegaT will report an error and fail
      to load them. Fixes are trivial operations and OmegaT assists
      troubleshooting with the related error message. You can ask the user
      group for advice if you have problems.</para>

      <para><application/>OmegaT exports version 1.4 TMX files (both level 1
      and level 2). The level 2 export is not fully compliant with the level 2
      standard, but is sufficiently close and will generate correct matches in
      other translation memory tools supporting TMX Level 2. If you only need
      textual information (and not formatting information), use the level 1
      file that OmegaT has created.</para>

    </note>

    <para>Before segments get translated, you may wish to pre-process them or
    address them in some other way than is possible with OmegaT. For example,
    if you wish to create a pseudo-translation for testing purposes, OmegaT
    enables you to create an additional tmx file that contains all segments of
    the project. The translation in this tmx can be either</para>

        <para>translation equals source (default)</para>

    <para>The tmx file can be given any name you specify. A pseudo-translated
    memory can be generated with the following command line parameters:</para>

    <para><literal>java -jar omegat.jar --pseudotranslatetmx=&lt;filename&gt;
    [pseudotranslatetype=[equal|empty]]</literal></para>

    <para>Replace <literal>&lt;filename&gt;</literal> with the name of the
    file you wish to create, either absolute or relative to the working
    directory (the directory you start <application>OmegaT</application>
    from). The second argument <literal>--pseudotranslatetype</literal> is
    optional. Its value is either <literal>equal</literal> (default value, for
    source=target) or <literal>empty</literal> (target segment is empty). You
    can process the generated tmx with any tool you want. To reuse it in
    <application>OmegaT</application> rename it to <emphasis>project_save.tmx
    </emphasis> and place it in the <literal>omegat</literal>-folder of your

    <para>Very early versions of <application>OmegaT</application> were
    capable of segmenting source files into paragraphs only and were
    inconsistent when numbering formatting tags in HTML and Open Document
    files. <application>OmegaT</application> 2.5 can detect and upgrade such
    tmx files on the fly to increase fuzzy matching quality and leverage your
    existing translation better, saving you the work of doing this
    manually.</para>

    <para>A project's tmx will be upgraded only once, and will be written in
    upgraded form into the <filename>project-save.tmx</filename>; legacy tmx
    files will be upgraded on the fly each time the project is loaded. Note
    that in some cases changes in file filters in
    <application>OmegaT</application> 2.5 may lead to totally different
    segmentation; as a result, you will have to upgrade your translation
    manually in such rare cases.</para>
